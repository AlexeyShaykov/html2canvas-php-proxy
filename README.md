## <s>html2canvas-php-proxy</s> Inphinit Cross Domain Proxy 2.0

This is the new version of "html2canvas-php-proxy", it will be a proxy for several uses and no longer exclusive to html2canvas, supporting any system that requires JSONP or WebProxy, it can also help to resolve issues with CORS.

Its main change is that it will now support composer-autoload (and the like)

Attention, it’s still in development, it’s not ready for use and it doesn’t even work, in a few more weeks it will be ready
