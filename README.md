## <s>html2canvas-php-proxy</s> Inphinit Cross Domain Proxy 2.0

This is the new version of "html2canvas-php-proxy", it will be a proxy for several uses and no longer exclusive to html2canvas, supporting any system that requires JSONP or WebProxy, it can also help to resolve issues with CORS.

Its main change is that it will now support composer-autoload (and the like)

Attention, it’s still in development, it’s not ready for use and it doesn’t even work, in a few more weeks it will be ready

## Inphinit PHP Framework

**Tip:** Try the Inphinit framework, it is light, fast, easy to learn and does not stifle your server

- https://inphinit.github.io/
- https://inphinit.github.io/pt/ (Português)

Installing using composer:

```
composer create-project inphinit/inphinit <folder name>
```

**Inphinit Cross Domain Proxy** works independently of frameworks, supports anyone and even projects without a framework, still be sure to try the **Inphinit framework**, see the benchmark:

- https://github.com/inphinit/inphinit/wiki/Frameworks-Comparison

**Inphinit framework** consumes less memory of server and is also able to respond to more HTTP requests in a second.
